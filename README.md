# Elliptic Curve Cryptography - naive version

## Description

This is a naive implementation of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) in Rust.
It is not meant to be used in production, but rather as a learning tool to understand the basics of ECC.

- [x] Implemented Finite fields arithmetic operations
- [x] Operations include Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Additive_Inverse, Multiplicative_inverse
- [x] ECC operations for point addition, point multiplication and scalar multiplication
- [x] Test cases added and all cases passing
