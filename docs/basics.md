# Basics of Elliptic curve

## What is Group?

A group can be defined as a set of elements with an operation(like addition and multiplication) that satisfies certain properties or axioms such as closure, associativity, identity and inverses.

## What is Subgroup?

A subset of a group that retains the properties of a group for the same operation.

## What is Ring?

A ring is a set where both add and multiply operations can be performed, but unlike groups, not every element needs to have a multiplicative inverse.

## What is Field?

It is essentially a ring where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse, combining properties of both groups and rings

## What is Finite field?

A finite field must have a finite number of elements with both the operations such as addition and multiplication, with properties like closure, associativity, identity, inverses and distributive.Each non-zero element has both additive and multiplicative inverse in the set.

## What is Abelian Group?

A finite field with an additional property of commutative.
